Dear Team ,
I had made booked a flight from Delhi To HoChiMinh City on 24th
October via Make my trip.
After making the payment ,due to some network issue, I realised that
the amount had been deducted twice and duplicate payment has been
posted to my account.
Kindly issue the refund for the same.
Thank you,
Rohin Satija
