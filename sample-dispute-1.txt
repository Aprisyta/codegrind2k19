Hi On Sunday, I was trying to make transaction of 3477 from iMobile using UPI feature of the app. While entering pin there was error message which said transaction failed. However my money got deducted which i realised later. This happened 5 times. The error message was displayed 5 times upon which i used another mode of payment from a different bank. 
I can see that there is just one credit for transaction. While for the rest 4 times, amount has been debited from my account. 
I am attaching screenshot for your reference. 
Thank You Aprisyta
